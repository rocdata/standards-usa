description: >
  Controlled vocabulary for describing the different elements within the
  Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and the
  Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science and Technical Subjects.
notes: >
  The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and the
  Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science and Technical Subjects
  are different in many ways, and the hierarchies from the framework to the component level reflect some of those differences.
  Clusters are part of the hierarchy in Math but not ELA/Literacy.
  A single level in the identifiers represents strand and domain for ELA/Literacy,
  whereas strands do not exist in Math. To require conformance in the hierarchical
  structures in the two frameworks would ignore the fundamental organizational
  characteristics of the two standards documents and would compromise the integrity
  of the architecture of each set of standards.
  In ELA/Literacy, the Domains, such as Reading Standards for Literature (RL) fully
  reflect the Strand (Reading), so this level of the hierarchy reflects the Strand and Domain combination.
  In Math, Set refers to the sets of content and practice standards.
  In ELA/Literacy it is an optional designation for the anchor standards.
